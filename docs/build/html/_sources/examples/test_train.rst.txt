Training and Testing
=====================

Here is an example of how to use train a forestry estimator and use it to make 
predictions. 

.. code-block:: Python

    from Rforestry.forestry import forestry ### Should be changed!!!!
    from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    import numpy as np

    # Getting the dataset
    X, y = fetch_california_housing(return_X_y=True)

    # Splitting the data into testing and training datasets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.33, random_state=42)

    # Create a forestry object
    fr = forestry(scale=False)

    print('Traingng the forest')
    fr.fit(X_train, y_train)

    print('Making predictions')
    preds = fr.predict(X_test)

    print('The coefficient of determination is' + 
            str(fr.score(X_test, y_test)))
